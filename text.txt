Ruskin Bond used to spend his summer at his grandmotherâ€™s house in Dehradun.
While taking the train, he always had to pass through a small station called Deoli. No one used to get down at the station and nothing happened there.
Until one day he sees a girl selling fruit and he is unable to forget her.
